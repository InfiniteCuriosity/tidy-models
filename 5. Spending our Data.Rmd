Start by loading the required packages in two lines of code:

```{r Load all required packages in two lines of code}

Packages <- c("tidymodels", "caret")
lapply(Packages, library, character = TRUE)

tidymodels_prefer(quiet = FALSE)

```

Start with code for multi-core processing

```{r multi-core processing}

library(doParallel)
cl <- makePSOCKcluster(10)
registerDoParallel(cl)

```

There are several steps to creating a useful model, including parameter estimation, model selection and tuning, and performance assessment. At the start of a new project, there's usually an initial finite pull of data available for all these tasks, which we can think of as an available data budget. How should the date be applied to different steps or tasks?The idea of*data spending*is an important first consideration with modeling, especially as it relates to empirical validation.
